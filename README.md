# Sythetic-Data-Generation

generateDataset.blend is an empty project to run the script in.

## Instructions
Populate the Backgrounds/ and Models/ directory with your own assets.

The Models must have the same object name as the File itself.

The background images must all be the same size. 600 x 600. We provide the utility resize_images.py to make all the images the same size.
